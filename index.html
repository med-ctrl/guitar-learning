    <div class="box h1"><p>At one time or another, almost everyone has found themselves caught in the moment of listening to a great song and overcome by the urge to rip into an air guitar solo. And while mostly everyone can play air guitar, learning to play a real acoustic or electric guitar is something that takes practice and dedication.</p>
    <p>If you want to learn to play guitar, you might not know where to start. What is the best way to learn guitar? Can I learn guitar at home or do I need an instructor? Should I learn to play chords or scales first? Your mind may be brimming with questions and it can feel intimidating. You might also wonder if you’ll be good at guitar. In some instances, new players don’t always give themselves enough time to learn the basics and unfairly put a lot of pressure on themselves to “get good” right out of the gate.</p>
    <p>Relax! Learning to play guitar should be a fun experience that’s more about the journey than the destination. Even the best guitar players find new ways to express themselves and experiment with new techniques. As a beginner, one of the best ways to learn guitar is to start slowly and learn the style you love to play. Even new musicians can <a href="https://www.fender.com/play/guitar/collections/5-easy-songs-for-new-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn to play easy songs on guitar</a>, helping you put any new skills or chords that you learn into practice.

    <p>Anything worth doing is worth doing well -- and often, that means it takes time, patience, and practice in order to hone a particular skill. Learning to play guitar is no different. While you may wonder what is the easiest way to learn guitar, the truth is, there are no shortcuts or substitutions for developing a regular practice schedule.</p>
